Hello! I'm Shelley.

Around GitHub, you'll find me:

* Working as a core engineer on the [Electron.js project](https://github.com/electron/electron), on behalf of Microsoft
* Working as a core collaborator and Releaser on the [Node.js project](https://github.com/nodejs/node), where I'm also a member of the Technical Steering Committee.
* Messing around with native Node.js addons - particularly ones that [tie together](https://github.com/codebytere/node-mac-permissions) JavaScript and [funky](https://github.com/codebytere/node-mac-contacts) macOS functionality.
* Helping organize [QueerJS](https://queerjs.com/) - a meetup for everyone where Queer speakers take the stage.

Outside work, you'll find me:

* Listening to way too much music
* Reading
* Playing frisbee
* Running
* Doing crossword puzzles

I'm  **@codebytere** pretty much everywhere around the internet - feel free to drop me a line but i can't promise i'm the best DM-checker ðŸ˜….
